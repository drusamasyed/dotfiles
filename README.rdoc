= Q's minimal dotfiles

I try to keep my system as clean and close to factory build as possible, so my dotfiles are quite bare. I'm using Janus for MacVim so I've left my vim directory out as it's just the default.

== Installation
  git clone git://github.com/mistrQ/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
  cd ~/.dotfiles
  rake install

== Credits
* Ryan Bates and his awesome dotfiles
